# DreamScape AI

DreamScape AI is a web application that allows users to generate AI-powered wallpapers based on their custom prompts. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP for animations, it leverages the DeepSeek API (via Hugging Face) to create stunning, high-quality wallpapers in various styles and resolutions.
